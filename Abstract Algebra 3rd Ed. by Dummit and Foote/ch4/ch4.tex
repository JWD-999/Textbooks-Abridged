 \subsection{Group Actions and Permutation Representations}
 
 
 \begin{dfn} Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $A$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{kernel} of the action is the set of elements of $G$ that act trivially on every element of $A$: $\{g\in G \mid g \cdot a = a $ for all $a\in A\}$.
    \item For each $a\in A$ the \textit{stabilizer} of $a$ in $G$ is the set of elements of $G$ that fix the element $a$: $\{g\in G \mid g\cdot a = a\}$ and is denoted by $G_a$.
    \item An action is \textit{faithful} if its kernel is the identity.
   \end{enumerate}
 \end{dfn}
 
 
 \begin{nt}
  The kernel pf an action is precisely the same as the kernel of the associated permutation representation as defined in the note in section 1.7 and is rephrased below. 
 \end{nt}
 
 
 \begin{prop}
  For any group $G$ and any nonempty set $A$ there is a bijection between the actions of $G$ on $A$ and the homomorphisms of $G$ into $S_A$.
 \end{prop}
 
 
 \begin{dfn}
  If $G$ is a group a \textit{permutation representation} of $G$ into the symmetric group $S_A$ for some nonempty set $A$. We shall say a given action of $G$ on $A$ \textit{affords} or \textit{induces} the associated representation of $G$. 
 \end{dfn}
 
 
 \begin{prop}
  Let $G$ be a group acting on the nonempty set $A$. the relation on $A$ defined by 
  \[a\sim b \text{ if and only if } a=g\cdot b \text{ for some } g\in G\]
  is an equivalence relation. For each $a\in A$, the number of elements in the equivalence class containing $a$ is $|G:G_a|$, the index of the stabilizer of $a$.
 \end{prop}
 
 
 \begin{dfn}
  Let $G$ be a group acting on the set $A$.
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item The equivalence class $\{g\cdot \mid g\in G\}$ is called the \textit{orbit} of $G$ containing $a$.
   \item The action of $G$ on $A$ is called \textit{transitive} if there is only one orbit, i.e., given any two elements $a,b\in A$ there is some $g\in G$ such that $a=g\cdot b$.
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{dfn}
 
 
 \begin{nt}
  ~\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every element of $S_n$ has a unique cycle decomposition
    \item Subgroups of symmetric groups are called \textit{permutation groups}.
    \item The orbits of a permutation group will refer to its orbits on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$
    \item The orbits of an element $\sigma \in S_n$ will refer to the orbits of the group $\langle \sigma \rangle$.
   \end{enumerate}
 \end{nt}
 
 
 \subsection{Group Acting on Themselves by Left Multiplication - Cayley's Theorem}
 
 
 
 %%% MIGHT WANT TO REMOVE
 \begin{nt}
  In this section $G$ is any group and we first consider $G$ acting on itself (i.e., $A=G$) by left multiplication:
  \[g \cdot a=g a \quad \text { for all } g \in G, a \in G\]

When $G$ is a finite group of order $n$ it is convenient to label the elements of $G$ with the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$ in order to describe the permutation representation afforded by this action. In this way the elements of $G$ are listed as $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n$ and for each $g \in G$ the permutation $\sigma_g$ may be described as a permutation of the indices $1,2, \ldots, n$ as follows:
\[\sigma_g(i)=j \quad \text { if and only if } \quad g g_i=g_j.\]
 \end{nt}
 
 
 \begin{thm}
  Let $G$ be a group, let $H$ be a subgroup and let $G$ act by left multiplication on the set $A$ of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Let $\pi_H$ be the associated permutation representation afforded by this action. Then 
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item $G$ acts transitively on $A$
   \item the stabilizer of $G$ of the point $1H\in A$ us the subgroup $H$
   \item the kernel of the action (i.e., the kernel of $\pi_H$) is $\cap_{x\in G} xHx^{-1}$, and ker$\pi_H$ is the largest normal subgroup of $g$ contained in $H$.
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{thm}
 
 
 \begin{cor}
  (Cayley's Theorem) Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of symmetric group. If $G$ is a group of order $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$.
 \end{cor}
 
 
 \begin{cor}
  If $G$ is a finite group of order $n$ and $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, then any subgroup of index $p$ is normal (Note that a group of order $n$ need not have a subgroup of order $p$).
 \end{cor}
