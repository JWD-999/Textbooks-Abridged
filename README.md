# Textbooks-Abridged

My idea behind this project is to create a way to quickly find a definition or result from a textbook without having search through its exposition. 

### Abridged Text:
- Abstract Algebra 3rd ed. by Dummit and Foote ([pdf](Abstract%20Algebra%203rd%20Ed.%20by%20Dummit%20and%20Foote/main.pdf), [LaTex](https://github.com/JWD-999/Textbooks-Abridged/tree/main/Abstract%20Algebra%203rd%20Ed.%20by%20Dummit%20and%20Foote))
